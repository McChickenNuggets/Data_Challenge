This project focuses on 2020 California Proposition 16 as our topic.

### Background Information 
Proposition (Prop) 16: Allow diversity as a factor in public employment, education, and contracting decisions. 

A YES vote on this measure means: State and local entities could consider race, sex, color,
ethnicity, and national origin in public education, public employment, and public contracting to the extent allowed under federal and state law.

A NO vote on this measure means: The current ban on the consideration of race, sex, color,
ethnicity, and national origin in public education, public employment, and public contracting would remain in effect. 

Historical Timeline: 
 - mid-1960s: CA embraced Affirmative Action (AFA)
 - 1996: CA banned Affirmative Action as Prop 209 passed.
 - 2020: Prop 16 tries to restore Affirmative Action in CA. 

## Motivation
This project focuses on the impacts of PP16 (Proposition 16). We retrieve data from Twitter using rtweet and twitteR, and use text mining through 3 different sentiment-analysis to distinguish the opposition and support implied by the contexts of each tweet on Proposition 16. Using the result generated by sentiment-analysis, we construct a logistic model using the filtered-dataset and investigate the effectiveness, sensitivity, specificity of our model. Besides, combining the past admission summaries based on ethnicity from University of California, we generalize ideas from social media to make assumptions about the following consequences of Proposition 16 on UC Davis admission based on ethnicity.

### Research Questions
With our topics of interest, we developed three research questions relevant to Prop 16.
- Q1:  How controversial is Proposition 16? 
- Q2: Who is supporting and who is opposing Proposition 16?
- Q3: What would be the impact on UC Davis admission if Proposition 16 passes?
