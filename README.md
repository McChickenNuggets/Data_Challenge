This is a project focusing on the impacts of Proposition 16. We retrieve data from Twitter using rtweet, and then we use text mining mainly through the combining of 3 differnt sentiment-analysis to analyze the opposition and support implied by the contexts of each tweet on Proposition 16. Using the result generated by sentiment-analysis, we construct a logistic model using the filtered-dataset and investigate the effectiveness of the model. Besides, we also investigate the past admission summaries based on ethnicity using the dataset from University of Califonia
